# Project-1 - Life Relocated

Life Relocated is an app designed to allow the user to look up other locations in the country and compare various statistics to their current location. 


Overview
1. A user's local data is detected through geoip-db upon the page loading.
2. The user is invited to enter a location name in the search bar.  Upon clicking on the search button or pressing on the enter key, they will be taken to the results page.
3. The results page will display the location the user entered in Google Maps.
4. Comparative data about the user's current location and the searched location will appear on screen beside the map(this may take a moment to load).
5. The user can then perform another search by entering a new location in the search bar.  The results will always be compared to the user's current location.

JS logic can be tested in Chrome by using the Inspect feature, and going to the Console tab. Enter in a function to test the results.


### Break down into end to end tests

Source files have been extensively tested by displaying pages in Google Chrome and using visual verification.

### And coding style tests

This website was designed with consideration for multiple viewports, including mobile devices.  The layout can be viewed at multiple screen sizes to test responsiveness.
